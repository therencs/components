# components
This is a react demo project showcasing dynamic react component creation. I also used this project as an exercise for my abilities in CSS.
What I am most proud of with this project are some of the little details I used in CSS. These being the box-shadows, positioning, and the usage of psuedo elements.
I used psuedo elements specifically for the 'hero' banner portion of the site, and I am looking forward to learning more about them in the future.

THINGS TO DO:

- Add multiple pages
- Fix spacing between individual 'components' (Bakery, Meats, Produce, Deli)
- Add drop shadow on the header of the website
- Add more user interactivity
