This project demonstrates the use of passing props from parent components to their child derivatives as well as showcasing the Array.map() feature. 

Websites I used for UI inspiration: 

https://dakotafamilyfoods.com/
https://www.sobeys.com/en/

To run the website, get to the repository in the terminal, and type

"npm run start"

into the command line, thank you!

If the site doesn't load, it could be because node modules won't be in this repository. Just use npm install to reinstall dependencies.
